# FF Goodie Bags

A mod for Minetest that is mostly meant for the Floating Factories sub game I'm working on, but was segmented to allow easier use outside of the sub game. Doing this will hopefully encourage more people to use it, report bugs, and help fix code.

After downloading, rename the folder to ff_goodie_bags.

By default, there are no crafting recipes for the goodie bags as they would be way overpowered. This mod is meant for server admins, sub games, or players looking to create their own Minetest experience by adding items that can be selected and choosing how the goodie bags can be obtained, such as killing hostile mobs.
